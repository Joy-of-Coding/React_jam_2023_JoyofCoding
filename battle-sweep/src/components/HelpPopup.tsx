            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Setting up:</b> Strategically place a limited number of
                dragons in secret locations on the opposing player's grid in 2
                player mode.

                <b>Uncovering Tiles:</b> Tap or click on a tile to uncover it.
                If a tile contains an untrapped dragon, it bites and your game

              <li>
                <b>Setting traps:</b> The objective of the game is to trap and
                tame as many dragons as you can. Toggle the trap button and then
                click on the tile where you believe a dragon is hiding.{" "}
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Taming: </b>Once you have laid your traps, press and hold the
                numbered tile connected to your traps to tame the adjacent
                dragons inside.{" "}
                <b>Be careful though, if you're wrong â€“ your game is over!</b>
              </li>
