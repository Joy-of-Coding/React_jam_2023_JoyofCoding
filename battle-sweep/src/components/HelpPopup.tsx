      <h2>Capture the Crabs</h2>
          {/* <p>Capture the Crabs is an exciting and strategic two-player game that combines the classic elements of Minesweeper and Battleship. In this game, players must strategically deploy <b>hidden crabs</b> on their opponent's grid while also skillfully navigating their own lava field.</p> */}
          <h3>How To Play</h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Setting up the lava field:</b> At the start of the game, strategically place a limited number of crabs in secret locations on the opposing player's grid.</li>
              <li><b>Uncovering Tiles:</b> Tap or click on a tile to uncover it. If a tile contains an opponent's crab, it bites with its lava claw and your game is over.</li>
              <li><b>Setting traps:</b> The objective of the game is to trap as many crabs as you can.  To trap a crab you must first place a trap by tapping the trap button and then tapping the tile of the lava field where you believe the crab is. </li>
              <li><b>Trap the crabs: </b>Deselect the trap button and tap the same tile to trigger the trap and catch the crab.</li>
              <li><b>Winning:</b> To win, you must successfully trap more crabs than your opponent.</li>
              <li><b>Tip: </b>In either 'Trap' mode or not, you can trap crabs quickly by long pressing a number tile adjacent to any trap. Any correctly placed traps adjacent to that tile will trap the crabs. In this way you can trap multiple crabs at once. <b>Be careful though, if you're wrong â€“ your game is over!</b></li>
            </ul>  
          </p>
