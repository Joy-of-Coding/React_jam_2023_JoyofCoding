## Three projects:

### advance-game:"Untitiled" Title
undetermined set up, a space for more advanced students to build a combat platformer if desired

### infinite-words-game: "Infinite Wordsearch" Title
word search combined with match 3 replacement of letters functionality

could have timed games to challenge in multiplayer

could add blank unusable blocks to increase difficulty (stretch)

### joy-game: "Share The Joy" Title
This ReactJam mobile game is an adaptation and expansion of the game ["Pass the Pandas"](https://www.ultraprogames.com/products/pass-the-pandas) by Ken Gruhl and Quentin Weir.
