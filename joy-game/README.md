# Pass the Joy

This ReactJam mobile game is an adaptation and expansion of the game ["Pass the Pandas"](https://www.ultraprogames.com/products/pass-the-pandas) by Ken Gruhl and Quentin Weir.

## Rules

### Object of the Game
Be the first player to have zero dice.

## Gameplay Loop
Each turn, players rolls all of their dice. Each die roll causes different results.
- **Balloons:** These dice are removed from the game, as Balloons float away.
- **Gifts:** These dice are given to any other player of your choice. If multiple Gifts are rolled, those dice can be given to the same player or split among mutliple players in any way.
- **Noisemakers:** These dice are compared with the amount of Noisemakers that the previous player rolled. If they have more Noisemakers thant you, they must pass you the difference.
