# Rune Games SDK

[![NPM latest version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/rune-games-sdk)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rune-games-sdk) [![NPM snapshot version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/rune-games-sdk/snapshot.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rune-games-sdk) [![GitHub Workflow Status (staging)](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/rune/rune-games-sdk/CI/staging)](https://github.com/rune/rune-games-sdk/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Astaging)

Tiny SDK for making your HTML5 game run inside [Rune](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.rune.tincan).

## Install

Include the following line in your `index.html` file before loading any other JS scripts:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/rune-games-sdk@4.11.0/singleplayer.js"></script>
```

## Quick Start

Adapting your HTML5 game to run on Rune is really simple.

```js
// Your game setup code...

// Initialize the Rune SDK once your game is fully ready.
// Rune will invoke these functions based on player actions in the app interface.
Rune.init({
  resumeGame: myResumeGameFunction,
  pauseGame: myPauseGameFunction,
  restartGame: myRestartGameFunction,
  getScore: myGetScoreFunction,
})

// When the player loses the game, inform the SDK
Rune.gameOver()
```

That's all it takes to integrate your game with Rune! You can take a look at our [example game](https://github.com/rune/rune-games-sdk/blob/staging/examples/breakout/index.js) for inspiration.

### Running Your Game

The [Rune CLI](https://github.com/rune/rune-games-cli) runs your game in a mock Rune app and makes debugging easy.

```bash
npm install -g rune-games-cli
cd my-game-folder
rune start
```

Once your game is working, run `rune upload` to upload your game to millions of players! ðŸ¥³

## Core API

- [`Rune.init`](https://github.com/rune/rune-games-sdk#runeinit)
- [`Rune.gameOver`](https://github.com/rune/rune-games-sdk#runegameover)

### Rune.init

The init function should be called after your game is fully ready. At this point, the game can show animations to entice the player, but should not start the actual gameplay as the game may be preloaded.

```js
Rune.init({
  resumeGame: myResumeGameFunction,
  pauseGame: myPauseGameFunction,
  restartGame: myRestartGameFunction,
  getScore: myGetScoreFunction,
})
```

The Rune SDK uses the functions you provide to `Rune.init()` to communicate with your game.

- #### resumeGame

  Rune will call this function when:

  1. The player first decides to start your game by hitting play.
  2. The player had paused the game and subsequently presses play again.

  Your game should start / resume the gameplay.

- #### pauseGame

  Rune will call this function when:

  1. The player presses the pause button while playing.

  Your game should instantly freeze all gameplay and wait until `resumeGame` is called.

- #### restartGame

  Rune will call this function when:

  1. The player presses the restart button in the middle of a game.
  2. The player has lost a game and chooses to play it again.

  Your game should reset all gameplay back to the experience as a completely new player, including resetting the score.

- #### getScore
  Rune may request your game's score at anytime by calling this function, which should return your game's score. For the Rune leaderboard logic to work correctly, your game's score should:
  - be an integer
  - be between 0 and 1 billion
  - treat higher scores as better

### Rune.gameOver

When the player loses or completes the game, call `Rune.gameOver()`.

```js
Rune.gameOver()
```

- Rune will check if it's a new high score and encourage the player to share your game or play again.
- Your game should freeze until `restartGame` is called.
- Your game need not show a "game over" screen. Rune overlays a standardized high score interface to the user.

## Daily Challenges (optional)

Rune has built-in support for daily challenges. Why support daily challenges?

1. There's something new and exciting in your game every day. Different colors / maps / physics â€” it's completely up to your creativity and keeps your game entertaining for dedicated players!
2. Your game becomes deterministic, meaning that all players will have the same gameplay experience. This makes it more fun to compete!
3. Rune will automatically add daily challenge leaderboards for your game. Players love having a fresh leaderboard to compete on every day!

There are two ways to support daily challenges:

- [`Rune.getChallengeNumber`](https://github.com/rune/rune-games-sdk#runegetchallengenumber)
  - Suitable for iterating through a fixed set of levels / maps.
  - For example, a puzzle game with 20 different puzzles.
- [`Rune.deterministicRandom`](https://github.com/rune/rune-games-sdk#runedeterministicrandom)
  - Suitable for generating maps.
  - For example, a racing game where the turns in the racetrack and obstacles are randomly generated.

### Rune.getChallengeNumber

Returns a challenge number that is incremented daily.

```js
const challengeNumber = Rune.getChallengeNumber()
```

Often games have a fixed list of maps, powerups, artwork or other kinds of content. You can use the challenge number to iterate through these so that players experience a new one every day. For instance, you can use the modulo operator to iterate through a fixed list of maps:

```js
const mapIds = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] // Define your fixed list of maps

const challengeNumber = Rune.getChallengeNumber() // Get today's challenge number

const mapId = mapIds[challengeNumber % mapIds.length] // Get deterministic mapId
```

### Rune.deterministicRandom

Returns a value between 0 and 1 in a deterministic way.

```js
const obstacleSpeed = Rune.deterministicRandom()
```

Rune provides a deterministic random number generator that uses the challenge number as seed. This random number generator will always provide the same random values for the same challenge number.

You can use `Rune.deterministicRandom()` instead of `Math.random()` in your map generation code to ensure all players play the same map. The `Rune.deterministicRandom()` function returns a value between 0 and 1 similar to `Math.random()`.

You should only use `Rune.deterministicRandom()` for your map generation and not as a generic replacement for `Math.random()`. This is because each call to `Rune.deterministicRandom()` will iterate through the random values. Any unintentional calls to `Rune.deterministicRandom()` would therefore break the deterministic randomness.

## Audio

Your game can have music and sound effects. Rune will automatically mute your game while it is being loaded etc.
